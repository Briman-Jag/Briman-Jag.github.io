      <h3><strong>Topic #1: What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’</strong></h3>
      <div class = "ind">
      <p>The line "import java.utility.Scanner" tells the program to import the Scanner java utility package to be used in the program. Java packages contain utility classes that can be called upon with import java.util.
        The Scanner is a predefined class that is used to get inputs from users such as strings, ints, and doubles.</p></div>

      <h3><strong>Topic #2: What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</strong></h3>
      <div class = "ind">
      <p> Void is a keyword in java used to specify that the method does not have a return type. So if it's called upon in another code it won't return anything.
        A method declaration with a return type like string is used to return value, like a message, in the code for the program to process further.</p></div>

      <h3><strong>Topic #3: What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.</strong></h3>
      <div class = "ind">
      <p> Casting a double into an int is something that will cause an error in the program. This is because a double is a different and more complex return type
        than an int. Ints are whole numbers (2,1,0,-1,-2) , while doubles are floating-point numbers used for more exact calculations(2.0,1.5,0.5,-2.5). This error can
        happen in a program that asks the user to insert a number and the user enters a decimal number, but have it set to "keyboard.nextInt()" instead of "keyboard.nextDouble()".</p></div>

      <h3><strong>Topic #4: What experience do you have coding? What have you created already? What do you want to create during/after the program?</strong></h3>
      <div class = "ind">
      <p> I took a few courses in Java about 5-6 years ago where I learned how to familiarize myself with the coding language structure as well as make very basic utility programs,
        which were all saved on a computer that broke. So it definitely feels like I'm starting java all over from scratch. One thing that my education lacked was focus on the front end, which is something I wish I had gained more experience in. Going through this prework process has made me
        realize that coding is something you do really need to practice on frequently like with using a new language or else most of it won't stick. I've been slowly refamiliarizing
        myself throughout this process, but have forgotten enough to where this feels almost brand new to me. So I would like to get further than I did before and learn how to create more intricate and aesthetically pleasing software.</p></div>

      <h3><strong>Topic #5: What is your ultimate goal in attending Skill Distillery? How are you going to achieve it? What is your big 'why'?</strong></h3>
      <div class = "ind">
      <p> My ultimate goal is becoming a computer programmer because I see it as an opportunity to learn all the things going on “under the hood” that isn’t seen by everyday users and believe it
         will further my appreciation for technology when I learn about the code used to make things work. Programming is such a versatile skill to have and I feel that it will open a lot of professional opportunities as well as be something I can use for my own creative endeavors.
         I think I'll achieve becoming a programmer by letting my optimistic sense of curiosity drive me to want to try out new things, think critically about problems, ask questions, and have fun figuring out solutions to those problems.
         My big 'why' has to do with me being a technology fanatic. I've been in the IT field for a while, so I’ve developed this curiosity wanting to know how everything works and it drives me to continue learning new tech skills.</p></div>
